# Approov Integration Quickstarts

[Approov](https://approov.io) is an API security solution used to verify that requests received by your backend services originate from trusted versions of your mobile apps.


## The Quickstarts

The quickstart code for the Approov token check in the Tyk API Gateway is split into two implementations. The first gets you up and running with a JWT token checking. The second runs as a Tyk Middleware via a Python plugin:

* [Approov Token JWT Quickstart](/docs/APPROOV_TOKEN_QUICKSTART.md)
