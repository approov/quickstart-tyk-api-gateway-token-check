# Approov Token Quickstart

This quickstart is for developers familiar with Tyk who are looking for a quick intro into how they can add [Approov](https://approov.io) into an existing project. Therefore this will guide you through the necessary steps for adding Approov to an existing Tyk API Gateway.

## Why?

To lock down your API server to your mobile app. Please read the brief summary in the [README](/README.md#why) at the root of this repo or visit our [website](https://approov.io/product.html) for more details.

## Requirements

To complete this quickstart you will need to already have an Tyk API Gateway created, and the Approov CLI tool installed.

* [Tyk API Gateway](https://tyk.io/docs/getting-started/)
* [Approov CLI](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-installation/#approov-tool) - Learn how to use it [here](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/)

## Approov Setup

To use Approov with the Tyk API Gateway we need a small amount of configuration. First, Approov needs to know the API domain that will be protected. Second, the Tyk API Gateway needs the Approov Base64 encoded secret that will be used to verify the tokens generated by the Approov cloud service.

### Configure API Domain

Approov needs to know the domain name of the API for which it will issue tokens.

Add it with:

```bash
approov api -add your.tyk-api-gateway.domain.com
```

Adding the API domain also configures the [dynamic certificate pinning](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-dynamic-pinning) setup, out of the box.

> **NOTE:** By default the pin is extracted from the public key of the leaf certificate served by the domain, as visible to the box issuing the Approov CLI command and the Approov servers.

### Approov Secret

Approov tokens are signed with a symmetric secret. To verify tokens, we need to grab the secret using the [Approov secret command](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/#secret-command) and plug it into the Tyk API Gateway configuration to check the signatures of the [Approov Tokens](https://www.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-tokens) that it processes.


To retrieved the Approov secret you need to enable your `admin` role with:

```bash
eval `approov role admin`
````

Retrieve the Approov secret with:

```bash
approov secret -get base64
```

Keep it at hand, because you will need it in the next step.

## Approov Token Check

To check the Approov token in any existing Tyk API Gateway project we just need to enable the JWT chack and to create a security policy for the API we want to protect with Approov.

First, create a new security policy for the Approov token check. Tyk supports several ways of creating a security policy, but all of them require the same fields to be given, therefore use the approach you are more comfortable with, and ensure that the following fields are set:

```json
{
    "approov": {
      "access_rights": {
        "___YOUR_API_ID_HERE___": {
          "allowed_urls": [],
          "api_id": "___YOUR_API_ID_HERE___",
          "api_name": "___YOUR_API_NAME_HERE___}",
          "versions": [
              "Default"
          ]
        }
      },
      "org_id": "___YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE___",
      "active": true,
      "name": "Approov",
      "rate": 0,
      "per": 1,
      "quota_max": -1,
      "state": "active",
      "tags": ["Approov"]
    }
}
```

Next, you need to enable the JWT check with the `approov` security policy on the API you want to protect with Approov. To update the API use the method of your preference and ensure that the API definition has the following fields set:

```json
"auth": {
    "auth_header_name": "Approov-Token"
},
"jwt_signing_method": "hmac",
"jwt_identity_base_field": "iss",
"jwt_default_policies": ["approov"],
"jwt_source": "___YOUR_APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET_HERE___"
```

**NOTE**: Enabling the JWT check will disable your current API key check, therefore if this approach for the Approov integration doesn't fit in your use case then please [contact us](https://approov.io/contact) to discuss alternative integrations of Approov in the Tyk API Gateway.

Finally, reload your Tyk API Gateway and confirm that API requests without a correctly signed and not expired `Approov-Token` header will fail. The next section has some guidance on how to test your Approov integration.

A full working example can be found at [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).

## Test your Approov Integration

The following examples below use cURL to perform the API requests.

For more testing scenarios see the full working example for a Tyk API Gateway at [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).

### With Valid Approov Tokens

Generate a valid token example from the Approov Cloud service:

```bash
approov token -genExample your.tyk-api-gateway.domain.com
```

Then make the request with the generated token:

```bash
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.tyk-api-gateway.domain.com' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The request should be accepted. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Length: 53
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 16:11:33 GMT
Server: gunicorn/19.9.0
X-Ratelimit-Limit: -1
X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 0
X-Ratelimit-Reset: 0

{
  "uuid": "35168518-b391-40ff-82c7-4ed2743837d6"
}
```

### With Invalid Approov Tokens

Generate an invalid token example from the Approov Cloud service:

```bash
approov token -type invalid -genExample your.tyk-api-gateway.domain.com
```

Then make the request with the generated token:

```bash
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.tyk-api-gateway.domain.com' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_INVALID_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json
X-Generator: tyk.io
Date: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 16:10:44 GMT
Content-Length: 56

{
    "error": "Key not authorized: token has expired"
}
```
